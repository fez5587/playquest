To create a web interface that displays a spreadsheet of the contents of a CSV file, follow these steps:

1. Set up a basic HTML structure for your web page.
2. Use CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing.
3. Include a file input element in your HTML form to allow users to upload the CSV file.
4. Use JavaScript to handle the file upload and read the contents of the CSV file.
5. Parse the CSV data and convert it into a format that can be displayed in a table.
6. Generate an HTML table dynamically using JavaScript and populate it with the CSV data.
7. Display the table on the web page, allowing users to view the spreadsheet-like data.

For the database part, consider using a lightweight database like SQLite. Store the CSV data in the database and retrieve it when needed.

Remember to handle any potential errors and validate the CSV data to ensure it meets your requirements.
